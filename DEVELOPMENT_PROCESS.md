- **RxJS** - Reactive programming for state management

---

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning & Context Setting

**Objective:** Establish clear project goals and constraints before writing code.

#### Steps:
1. **Define the Problem**
   - Identified usability issues from ISC Portal focus group reports
   - Referenced Q2 2025 Employee Survey data (81% system issues, pNPS: -4)
   - Documented heuristic violations using Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics

2. **Set Project Scope**
   - Created prototype to demonstrate solutions (not production code)
   - Focused on high-impact usability improvements
   - Prioritized interactive demonstrations over full functionality

3. **Establish Design Principles**
   - Material Design 3 compliance
   - Consistent component patterns
   - Accessibility considerations
   - Responsive layout requirements

**Key Artifacts Created:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI assistant instructions and project context
- `BUSINESS_CONTEXT.md` - Strategic business alignment
- `MASTER_PLAN.md` - Phased implementation roadmap

---

### Phase 2: Component-Driven Development

**Objective:** Build reusable components that solve specific usability problems.

#### Base Architecture Pattern

**1. Create Reusable Base Components**

Example: Base Table Component
```
â”œâ”€â”€ base-table.component.ts       # Logic & state management
â”œâ”€â”€ base-table.component.html     # Template structure
â”œâ”€â”€ base-table.component.scss     # Styling
â””â”€â”€ base-table.config.ts          # Configuration interface
```

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for table behavior
- Consistent UX across all data tables
- Easy to update styling globally
- Reduces code duplication

**2. Page-Specific Implementations**

Each page uses the base component with custom configuration:
```typescript
// circuits-unified.component.ts
this.tableConfig = {
  tableType: 'quick-filter',
  tableId: 'circuits-table',
  title: 'Circuits',
  columns: [...],
  filtering: {...},
  export: {...},
  pagination: {...}
};
```

**3. Progressive Enhancement**

Build features incrementally:
- Start with basic table display
- Add filtering and search
- Implement pagination
- Add export functionality
- Include help system
- Refine visual design

---

### Phase 3: AI-Assisted Iterative Development

**Objective:** Use Claude Code to rapidly prototype and refine features.

#### Typical Feature Development Cycle

**1. Request Feature**
```
User: "Add a help button to the Circuits page that opens a side panel
       with contextual help content"
```

**2. Claude Code Analysis**
- Reads relevant files to understand current implementation
- Identifies required components and dependencies
- Plans the implementation approach

**3. Implementation**
- Creates new components if needed
- Updates existing files with new features
- Follows established patterns and conventions
- Maintains TypeScript type safety

**4. Verification**
- Uses Playwright scripts to verify visual layout
- Checks for alignment, spacing, and positioning
- Takes screenshots for documentation

**5. Iteration Based on Feedback**
```
User: "The help button needs to be on the same row as the Export button"

Claude:
- Uses Playwright to measure actual positions
- Calculates correct positioning values
- Updates CSS with precise measurements
- Verifies alignment with automated check
```

**6. Commit Changes**
- Detailed commit message explaining what and why
- Co-authored with Claude for transparency
- Links to issue or feature request

---

### Phase 4: Visual Consistency & Refinement

**Objective:** Ensure uniform appearance across all pages.

#### Audit-Driven Standardization

**Example: Search Input Standardization**

**Problem:** Different pages had inconsistent search field widths
- Clouds: 400px
- Circuits: 400px
- Sites: 300px
- Circuit Reports: 400px

**Solution Process:**

1. **Automated Audit**
```javascript
// Created Playwright script to measure all search inputs
const measurements = await page.evaluate(() => {
  // Measure actual rendered dimensions
  const searchFields = document.querySelectorAll('.search-field');
  return Array.from(searchFields).map(field => ({
    width: field.getBoundingClientRect().width,
    height: field.getBoundingClientRect().height
  }));
});
```

2. **Analysis**
- Identified inconsistencies
- Determined optimal standard (300px based on Material Design guidelines)
- Located root cause in base-table component

3. **Fix**
```scss
// Changed from:
.search-field {
  flex: 1;
  max-width: 400px;
}

// To:
.search-field {
  flex: 0 0 auto;
  width: 300px;
}
```

4. **Verification**
- Re-ran audit script
- Confirmed all pages now use 300px
- Took screenshots for documentation

## Claude Code Collaboration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Exploratory Investigation

**When to Use:** Understanding existing code structure

**Example Interaction:**
```
User: "Where are errors from the client handled?"

Claude:
1. Uses Grep to search for error handling patterns
2. Reads relevant files
3. Provides specific file paths and line numbers
4. Explains the error handling flow

Response: "Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer`
          function in src/services/process.ts:712"
```

### Pattern 2: Visual Verification with Playwright

**When to Use:** Ensuring pixel-perfect layouts

**Example Workflow:**
```
User: "The help button isn't aligned with the export button"

Claude:
1. Creates Playwright script to measure positions
2. Runs script and analyzes measurements
3. Identifies gap (e.g., 63px difference)
4. Updates CSS with calculated positioning
5. Re-runs verification to confirm fix
```

**Benefits:**
- Removes guesswork from layout issues
- Provides objective measurements
- Documents actual vs expected positions
- Catches issues before manual testing

### Pattern 3: Incremental Refinement

**When to Use:** Iterating on user feedback

**Example Flow:**
```
User: "Add timestamp footer like Circuits page"
Claude: [Implements footer]

User: "Put it on the same row as pagination"
Claude: [Adjusts layout]

User: "It's still not aligned properly"
Claude: [Uses Playwright to diagnose, fixes positioning]

User: "Perfect!"
```

**Key Principle:**
Don't try to get it perfect on first attempt. Iterate based on visual feedback and measurements.

### Pattern 4: Systematic Audits

**When to Use:** Ensuring consistency across multiple pages

**Example Process:**
```
User: "Search inputs look different across pages"

Claude:
1. Creates audit script visiting all pages
2. Measures dimensions of all search fields
3. Generates report showing inconsistencies
4. Proposes standardization approach
5. Implements fix in base component
6. Verifies all pages now consistent
7. Commits with detailed explanation
```

## Best Practices Learned

### 1. Use Playwright for Visual Verification

**Why:** Human observation is subjective; measurements are objective.

**How:**
```javascript
// Measure actual rendered positions
const positions = await page.evaluate(() => {
  const element = document.querySelector('.target');
  const rect = element.getBoundingClientRect();
  return { x: rect.x, y: rect.y, width: rect.width };
});

console.log('Element is at:', positions);
```

**Benefits:**
- Catches alignment issues of 1-2px
- Provides exact values for CSS adjustments
- Documents the verification process
- Can be re-run after changes

### 2. Read Before Writing

**Why:** Understanding existing patterns prevents inconsistent code.

**How:**
- Claude Code reads relevant files before making changes
- Identifies established patterns (naming, structure, styling)
- Follows existing conventions

**Example:**
```
Before adding help button to Clouds page:
1. Read Circuits page to see how it's implemented there
2. Match the pattern for consistency
3. Adapt only what's different for Clouds
```

### 3. Commit Frequently with Context

**Why:** Easy rollback and clear change history.

**Commit Message Structure:**
```
Short summary of what changed

CONTEXT: Why this change was needed
ISSUE: What problem it solves
CHANGES: Specific modifications made
VERIFICATION: How it was tested

ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### 4. Component Reusability

**Why:** Changes in one place update everywhere.

**Pattern:**
- Create base components for common patterns (tables, forms, modals)
- Page-specific components configure base components
- Shared styles in base component SCSS
- Page overrides only when absolutely necessary

### 5. TypeScript Strict Mode

**Why:** Catch errors at compile time, not runtime.

**Enforcement:**
```typescript
// Always define interfaces
interface TableConfig<T> {
  tableId: string;
  title?: string;
  columns: ColumnConfig<T>[];
  filtering?: FilterConfig;
}

// Use typed data
sites: Site[] = [];
filteredSites: Site[] = [];
```

### 6. Separation of Concerns

**Structure:**
- **Components** - UI logic and templates
- **Services** - Business logic and state management
- **Models/Interfaces** - Type definitions
- **Styles** - Visual presentation

**Example:**
```
SyncStatusService handles data refresh timing
â†“
CircuitsComponent uses service for sync info
â†“
Template displays "Last updated: X mins ago"
â†“
SCSS styles the timestamp footer
```

## Handling Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: Positioning Absolute Elements

**Problem:** Help buttons, floating actions, overlays

**Solution Pattern:**
```scss
.container {
  position: relative;

  .floating-element {
    position: absolute;
    top: 135px;  // Calculated via Playwright measurement
    right: 8px;
    z-index: 10;
  }
}
```

**Verification:**
```javascript
// Measure target element position
const targetY = targetElement.getBoundingClientRect().y;
const containerY = container.getBoundingClientRect().y;
const offsetNeeded = targetY - containerY;

console.log('Set top to:', offsetNeeded, 'px');
```

### Challenge 2: Material Design Form Fields

**Problem:** Angular Material form fields have complex DOM structure

**Solution Pattern:**
```html
<mat-form-field appearance="outline">
  <mat-label>Search</mat-label>
  <input matInput [(ngModel)]="searchTerm">
  <mat-icon matPrefix>search</mat-icon>
</mat-form-field>
```

```scss
::ng-deep mat-form-field {
  // Use ::ng-deep to pierce view encapsulation
  .mat-form-field-wrapper {
    // Target internal Material structure
  }
}
```

### Challenge 3: Filter Positioning in Complex Layouts

**Problem:** Filters need to appear after table header but before data

**Solution:**
```html
<div class="table-container">
  <app-base-table [config]="config"></app-base-table>

  <!-- Filters positioned absolutely to overlay after header -->
  <div class="filters-overlay" style="position: absolute; top: 65px;">
    <!-- Filter controls -->
  </div>
</div>
```

```scss
.table-wrapper {
  padding-top: 180px; // Make room for absolutely positioned filters
}
```
