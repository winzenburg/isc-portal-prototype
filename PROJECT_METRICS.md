   - Visual feedback loops accelerated convergence
   - Claude Code maintained context across sessions

4. **Git Commit Discipline**
   - Detailed commits created excellent documentation trail
   - Easy to rollback or cherry-pick changes
   - Commit messages serve as project narrative

### Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Material Design 3 Migration**
- Angular Material didn't fully support MD3
- Solution: Custom SCSS with CSS variables for theming

**Challenge 2: Table Consistency**
- 9 pages with different requirements
- Solution: Flexible base component with configuration system

**Challenge 3: Help System Discoverability**
- Risk of help features being overlooked
- Solution: 3-tier approach (inline, modal, panel) + command palette

**Challenge 4: Layout Refinement**
- Small misalignments accumulate to poor visual quality
- Solution: Playwright measurements + systematic audits

### Recommendations for Future Projects

1. **Start with Base Components** - Invest in solid foundation early
2. **Use Automated Visual Tests** - Playwright or similar for consistency
3. **Maintain Git Discipline** - Detailed commits pay dividends later
4. **Leverage AI for Iteration** - Perfect for refinement cycles
5. **Design System First** - Establish patterns before building pages
